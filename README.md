# JDBC-Dealership-Project ðŸš—

## Description of the Project

This is a simple Java console application designed to help a car dealership manage its vehicle inventory. It allows users to:

- Search for vehicles by price range, make/model, year, color, mileage, or type

- View the full inventory

- Add new vehicles to the inventory

- Remove vehicles when they are sold

The application uses a MySQL database to store dealership and vehicle data, loading and updating records through SQL queries

## Interesting Code Snippet
- statement.setDate(3, java.sql.Date.valueOf(leaseContract.getLeaseStart()));
- statement.setDate(4, java.sql.Date.valueOf(leaseContract.getLeaseEnd()));

These lines convert LocalDate objects (used in Java) into java.sql.Date so they can be stored in a SQL database. This was something I had to research and learn on my own during the project.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to add vehicles to the inventory so they can be sold or leased.
- As a user, I want to remove vehicles from the inventory so that it keeps the inventory UTD.
- As a user, I want to add a vehicle to the inventory so it can be listed for lease.
- As a user, I want to save lease details, so that the lease agreement is stored.
- As a user, I want to add a sales contract so that vehicle sales are properly recorded.

## Setup

- Main menu Options
1. Search vehicles
2. Add a vehicle
3. Add a contract
4. Remove a vehicle
5. Exit

- Selecting search vehicles shows a submenu with these options
1. By price range
2. By make/model
3. By year range
4. By color
5. By mileage range
6. By type
7. Back to Main Menu

### Prerequisites
- IntelliJ IDEA: Ensure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed, which you can download from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
- Java SDK: Make sure Java SDK is installed and configured in IntelliJ.
